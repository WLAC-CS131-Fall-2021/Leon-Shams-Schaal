# Using deep Q-learning to play Pong

I did my project on Deep Q-Learning, which is a method of applying machine learning to dynamic environments. In my video I describe the ins and outs of Deep Q-Learning and demonstrate its power by training an agent to play the game Pong.

Check out there video here: <https://youtu.be/agTkxtXneto>

To see the agent play skip to [9:06](https://youtu.be/agTkxtXneto?t=546) in the video.

If you want to train the agent yourself download this repository with the command

```python
pip install git+https://github.com/WLAC-CS131-Fall-2021/Leon-Shams-Schaal.git
```

then to run the agent enter the command

```python
rl-pong
```
