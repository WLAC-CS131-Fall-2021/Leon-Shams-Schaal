# Leon Shams-Schaal

I did my project on Deep Q-Learning which is a method of applying machine learning to dynamic environments. In my video I describe the ins and outs of Deep Q-Learning and demonstrate its power by teaching an agent to play the game Pong.

Check out there video here: 

If you want to train the agent yourself download this repository with the command

```python
pip install git+https://github.com/WLAC-CS131-Fall-2021/Leon-Shams-Schaal.git
```

then to run the agent enter the command

```python
rl-pong
```
